Here is an example of an ◊inline_function, and another ◊function{with}{arguments}.

This is a new paragraph, which contains a
◊long_function_call{on its own line}
which we might imagine evaluating to some text, and therefore *should* be surrounded by whitespace.

But in other cases we might want
◊one_function
◊another_function
with no whitespace between them, because they are both block elements.

Likely this will depend on the functions’ annotations.
