- Tightness is hokey.
  - Just automatically tighten {} contents at the syntactic level?
  - Attribute to specify tightness per-◊function
  - And, while we're at it, attribute to specify lazy eval e.g. for ◊ifrefs
- Turducken templates
- Rawness from extension, not hardwired
- Accept blank output from ◊functions
- Maybe rewire context dict to return None instead of throwing for missing attributes
- Error handling: catch and show markup line & col
- Smart quotes. Or not? Maybe just have the user do this. Don't be magic
- Tag functions for Markdown
