- clean up renderer and builder interfaces
- file-based functions should be scoped to their dir and subdirs
- .dryck files should be discovered and wrapped as objects (or classes?) on initialization
- better indentation for e.g. ul and ol
- BUG: Need to emit whitespace after stars at the ends of lines
- Fix line number for error
- Accept blank output from â—Šfunctions
- Maybe rewire context dict to return None instead of throwing for missing attributes
- Should @indented just be the default?
- Allow string input, especially for templates
- Bring some sanity to @raw, @block, &c
