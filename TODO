- avoid pycache in site subdir for _dryck.py
- does ◊loop even work?!
- clean up renderer and builder interfaces
- file-based functions should be scoped to their dir and subdirs
- .dryck files should be discovered and wrapped as objects (or classes?) on initialization
- better indentation for e.g. ul and ol
- BUG: Need to emit whitespace after stars at the ends of lines
- Accept blank output from ◊functions
- Should @indented just be the default?
- Allow string input, especially for templates
- Bring some sanity to @raw, @block, &c
